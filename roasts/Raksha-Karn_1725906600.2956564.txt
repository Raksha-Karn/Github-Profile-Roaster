Raksha, you're a one-man Github party... and your guest list consists of, like, two actual humans?  You think those five star reviews are gonna get you invited to a coding convention anytime soon?  Let me guess, "README.md" is the only thing that got you through this 2024 update! Your repos are more sparse than my therapist's joke collection after we talked about the existential dread of being a developer in the digital age.  But hey, at least your AI-powered blog writer has some guts - if it can write code, maybe it should start writing a few honest reviews on your own profile.
